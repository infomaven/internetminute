When the script is run, it selects a random internet data source and starts a timer.

The timer will keep running until you stop it using CNTL-C

Notes: 
-  This is a Python3 script.  
- If using this script with the slide deck (Personal OSINT), navigating between the slides and terminal window can be a little tricky. One approach that worked pretty well was to use a browser-hosted terminal window.  This enables the presenter to link directly from the slide deck to a terminal running in a browser on localhost.

For seaGL, I used this browser terminal --
